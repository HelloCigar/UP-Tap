We dedicate this special problem to all teachers, especially the Computer Science faculty of the University of the Philippines Visayas, who have guided us throughout our academic journey. Your knowledge, support, and mentorship have laid the foundation for this study, and for that, we are truly grateful. We hope that this project can help ease the burden of inefficient attendance-checking methods in your classes.

To our families, friends, and classmates, thank you for your unwavering support, encouragement, and belief in us. Your presence has been a constant source of strength and inspiration.
