\section{Overview}
\label{sec:overview}

Attendance plays an important role in improving academic performance of students. There is evidence that students who has lower attendance often has lower grades\cite{EJES3887}. Therefore it is usually enforced and recorded for most higher education institutions. However, the systems in place for recording the attendance are usually manual and time consuming.

The traditional pen and paper attendance system has existed since the invention of paper itself. It is used for time keeping by manually writing or checking the 'present' status in a paper log book. Manually writing names takes an average of 17 seconds per student \cite{shoewu:2014}, and for class size of 30 students that leads to approximately 8 minutes of class time wasted. While it is recognized that such system is time-consuming and wastes resources, it persisted because of it's familiarity. Going to class means bringing pen and paper for most students and teachers alike, so using the same material for recording attendance seemed the most practical.

In recent years, as laptops and portable computers became more accessible, some faculty of UP started transitioning to digital spreadsheets provided by services like Microsoft Excel. While it seemed to have moved the traditional pen and paper towards digitalization, another problem arises as this required manually roll calling students to say 'present'. It had the same problem of being a manual process. It is easily disrupted by a noisy class. Some time that was supposed to be utilized for immediate teaching was used for roll call.

Both systems mentioned are prone to errors and unnecessarily increases administrative burden for the faculty. Reduction in teaching time means frequently moving the lesson discussions by the faculty, with some topics being rushed or skip entirely by the end of semester. This reduces overall the quality of education students received and may negatively impact their readiness for subsequent courses they may take. 

Therefore, we propose a fully automatic, digital attendance system that addresses these concerns. We utilize the already distributed UP ID and pretrained face recognition models that ensures an easy, accurate, attendance keeping. It aims to ease the burden of faculty and students from manual methods of attendace system, allowing them to focus on class discussions instead.

\section{Problem Statement}
The current methods of taking attendance today such as the manual call roll, biometrics, and online or remote attendance provides challenges in terms of efficiency, security, and authenticity. Manual roll calls are time consuming, according to (Mahato \& Suman, 2013, p. 5875), it consumes an average of 5 to 15 minutes in order to complete an attendance using manual roll call attendance. It also provides a burden to some of the teachers through the disruptive behaviors of the students which lower the efficiency of manual roll call ("How Teachers Can Meet the Challenges," 2015). Biometrics attendance systems like fingerprint and facial scanning provide efficiency in taking an attendance but it is more costly and widely not accessible. The online or remote attendance system is only advisable in virtual class and not in face to face class as it is prone to attendance fraud.

Failure to resolve efficiency and a secured attendance system may lead to inaccurate attendance records and high risks of attendance fraud. These gaps may also affect the integrity in terms of attendance of the university. To fill those gaps, the solution should be the integration of RFID and facial recognition technology but there are uncertainties which are the efficient ways to integrate the real-time face capture while  managing the privacy concerns and also finding an optimal way to gather sensitive information which are the student’s biometric and their RFID serial number. 

Given the gaps of the current attendance system method, there is a need to design an attendance system with the integration of RFID and facial recognition technology which are:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Efficiently captures the real-time data using the RFID and facial recognition technology.
	\item  Ensure and maintain security and privacy of the student’s sensitive data such as their facial biometrics and unique serial number of their RFID.  
	\item Ensure compatibility with the university infrastructure which is the availability of RFID and the hardware for facial scanning. 
	\item 	Determine the effectiveness of the combination of the RFID and facial technology in the attendance system. 
\end{enumerate}


\section{Research Objectives}
\label{sec:researchobjectives}

\subsection{General Objective}
\label{sec:generalobjective}

This project aims to develop a web application that effectively uses the current UP RFID and face recognition for attendance checking and recording in the University of the Philippines Visayas. Additionally, it also aims to assess the performance of the application in terms of accuracy and efficiency.

%This subsection states the over--all goal that must be achieved to answer the problem.

This subsection is an elaboration of the general objective.  
It states the specific steps that must be undertaken to accomplish the general objective.  
These objectives must be \textbf{S}pecific, \textbf{M}easurable, \textbf{A}ttainable, \textbf{R}ealistic, \textbf{T}ime-bounded. Also, they are manageable and communicable.  

A specific objective start with ``to $<$verb$>$'' for example: to design/survey/review/analyze.

Studying a particular programming language or development tool (e.g., to study Windows/Object-Oriented/Graphics/C++ programming) to  accomplish the general objective is inherent in all thesis and, therefore, must not be included here.

\section{Scope and Limitations of the Research}
\label{sec:scopelimitations}

This project will not involve the training of face recognition models, as there are high-performance, pretrained models readily available. The focus will be on utilizing these existing face recognition models for the development of an effective attendance tracking system.

\section{Significance of the Research}
\label{sec:significance}

	Facial recognition has been in use mobile applications for validation of identity and the performance has significantly improved over the years. This allowed us to explore the possibility of using it in attendance tracking of students in UP Visayas as there are currently no system like it in place. We also intend for this project to be open-source. Some of the people that will benefit from our developed app are:
	
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Students - will benefit from the increased class time. This allow better retention of topics and lesson discussions. This complements the goal of recording attendance itself, which is to increase the quality of education the students receive.
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Faculty - will also benefit from the increased class time. An automated system will allow them to focus entirely on delivering the topics that need to be covered. It will lessen the possibility of skipping modules or topics needed by students to learn before taking their subsequent courses. 
	\end{itemize}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item UP System - Since the UP RFID are used across all constituent units of the UP System, our project can be used by any faculty under the UP System. They may also choose to create their own version as long as they also make their version open source, as stipulated in GNU GPLv3 license.
	\end{itemize}
	
	
	We also hope that this project will bring focus on the growing accessibility of facial recognition technologies and urge the community to explore on how it can be incorporated their own projects.
