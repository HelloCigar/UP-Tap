\chapter{Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations}

\section{Summary}

	The created system is an automated attendance checker with the use of an RFID together with facial authentication to eliminate inefficiencies in conventional practices at UP Visayas. The system integrated the UP RFID's exclusive identification with real-time facial identification using pretrained YOLOv8 and FaceNet models with 2 â€“ 3-second processing times per student. Major features were a Django-Nuxt web interface, hardware integration with Raspberry Pi, and two-factor authentication to maintain the CIA Triad principles (confidentiality, integrity, availability). Testing validated its superiority to manual roll calls and spreadsheet monitoring in terms of speed, accuracy, and fraud prevention, although light conditions and RFID reliance presented limitations.

\section{Conclusion}

\section{Recommendation}
	For future development and improvement of the system, the following recommendation are proposed:
	
	\begin{enumerate}
		\item \textbf{Additional Biometric Authentication}
	
		For the future enhancement of the system, it is recommended to consider the addition of other biometrics such as voice recognition for security enhancement.
		
		\item \textbf{Support for Virtual Classes}
		
		Expand the range of the system that supports virtual classes with the use of secure webcam verification.
		
		\item \textbf{Technical Upgrades}
		
		Replace Raspberry Pi with better computing devices such as NVIDIA Jetson for better and faster processing.
		
	\end{enumerate}
